# Ansible project template

(this "project" template has nothing to do with Ansible Tower "Projects")

## Usage

1. Copy these files to your project repository
2. Add hosts to inventory and change sample variables
3. Initialize hosts with `initial.sh` script
4. Install dependencies: `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p roles`
5. Finish initialization by executing `setup.yml` playbook
